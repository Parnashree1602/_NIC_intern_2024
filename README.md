# Document Management API

This project is a part of my summer internship at the National Informatics Centre (NIC), where I am developing a sophisticated document management framework. This project aims to create a comprehensive document management system that streamlines the process of storing, organizing, and accessing documents within an organization. The framework provides robust functionalities to manage documents efficiently, ensuring security and ease of access.




## Features

- User Authentication: Secure login and registration system for users.
- Document Upload: Allows users to upload documents with metadata.
- Document Search: Advanced search functionality to find documents quickly.
- Version Control: Maintains different versions of documents to track changes.
- Access Control: Restricts access to documents based on user roles.
- Audit Trail: Logs user actions for security and compliance.
